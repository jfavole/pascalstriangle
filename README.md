### Pascal's Triangle coding challenge: calculating binomial coefficients

For a given integer i, print a triangle of integers for which the value at the nth row and rth column is n!/(r! * (n - r)!), with indexing to start at zero (think, "The one at the top of the triangle is raised to zero, and anything raised to zero is one").
